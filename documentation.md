## Current Status (Update)
- Core functionality working: ingredient input, recipe matching, filters (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free), weights, missing ingredients.
- Interactive CLI implemented with user-friendly prompts.
- Data: recipes stored in `data/recipes.json`, can be extended via `scraper.py` (Allrecipes tested).
- Helper functions (`normalize_and_expand`, `recipe_matches_filters`, etc.) consolidated and cleaned.
- Known issues: UI not yet implemented, scraping dataset still small.
- Next steps: polish Streamlit UI, extend dataset, refine weights.
